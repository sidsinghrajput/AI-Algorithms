The Apriori algorithm is used in a transactional database to mine frequent item sets and then generate association rules.
It is popularly used in market basket analysis, where one checks for combinations of products that frequently co-occur in the database.
In general, we write the association rule for ‘if a person purchases item X, then he purchases item Y’ as : X -> Y.

Example: if a person purchases milk and sugar, then she is likely to purchase coffee powder.
This could be written in the form of an association rule as: {milk,sugar} -> coffee powder.
Association rules are generated after crossing the threshold for support and confidence.

The Support measure helps prune the number of candidate item sets to be considered during frequent item set generation.
This support measure is guided by the Apriori principle.
The Apriori principle states that if an itemset is frequent, then all of its subsets must also be frequent.
